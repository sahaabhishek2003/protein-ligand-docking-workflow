Example Docking Case Study

Target Protein:
SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease (PDB ID: 6LU7)

Objective:
Study protein–ligand interactions relevant to antiviral drug discovery.

Workflow Summary:
1. Protein structure retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6LU7).
2. Water molecules removed and protein prepared for docking.
3. Ligand molecule selected and optimized.
4. Docking simulation performed using docking software.
5. Binding affinity evaluated.
6. Docked complex visualized for interaction analysis.

Sample Observation:
Docking suggests stable ligand binding near active site residues,
indicating potential inhibition capability.

Note:
This example demonstrates docking workflow understanding for
educational purposes.
