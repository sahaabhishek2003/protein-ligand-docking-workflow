# Protein–Ligand Docking Workflow

This project summarizes a basic protein–ligand docking workflow
studied during MSc Bioinformatics training for understanding
structure-based drug discovery.

## Objective
To understand how protein–ligand interactions are evaluated using
molecular docking approaches in drug discovery research.

## Workflow Overview
1. Retrieval of protein structure from PDB database
2. Preparation of protein structure (removal of water, addition of hydrogens)
3. Ligand selection and preparation
4. Docking setup and execution
5. Evaluation of binding energy and docking poses
6. Visualization of protein–ligand interactions

## Learning Outcome
- Understanding docking workflow steps
- Basic interpretation of binding affinity results
- Exposure to computational drug discovery approaches

This repository will be expanded with scripts and example datasets.
